# Archive Folder

This folder contains historical planning documents that have been superseded by the Implementation Roadmap.

## Archived Documents

### PLAN.md (Archived 2025-12-03)

**Why archived**: Comprehensive 10-phase implementation plan created during initial analysis. Content has been reorganized and refined into:

- `../IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Strategic action plan for Ada (developer)
- `../FIELD_MAPPINGS.md` - Detailed field mapping reference (to be created)
- `../ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design documentation (to be created)

**Original purpose**: Document the complete data transformation strategy from ENTU to MUIS format, including phases, risks, and timeline estimates.

**Status**: Complete and frozen. Retained for historical reference and decision audit trail.

### SUMMARY.md (Archived 2025-12-03)

**Why archived**: Summary document that duplicated PLAN.md content. Made redundant by the Implementation Roadmap which provides both high-level overview and actionable task breakdown.

**Original purpose**: Executive summary of the planning phase deliverables.

**Status**: Complete and frozen. Content integrated into README.md status section and Implementation Roadmap.

## When to Reference These Documents

**Use archived documents when**:

- Auditing original planning decisions
- Understanding historical context
- Verifying initial scope and estimates
- Reviewing what changed during implementation

**Don't use archived documents for**:

- Current implementation work → Use `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- Field mapping reference → Use `FIELD_MAPPINGS.md` (to be created)
- Technical design → Use `ARCHITECTURE.md` (to be created)
- Project status → Use `README.md`

## Document Evolution

```text
Initial Planning (2025-12-03):
- PLAN.md created (10 phases, 5500+ words)
- SUMMARY.md created (summary of PLAN.md)

Reorganization (2025-12-03):
- Redundancy identified (50%+ duplicate content)
- Documents archived
- New strategic structure created:
  * IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (Ada's action plan)
  * ARCHITECTURE.md (technical design)
  * FIELD_MAPPINGS.md (mapping reference)
```

## Archival Policy

Documents are archived (not deleted) to:

1. **Preserve decision history** - Why choices were made
2. **Enable auditing** - Track scope changes
3. **Support knowledge transfer** - Historical context for new team members
4. **Maintain continuity** - Reference original requirements

Archived documents are **frozen** - no updates or modifications after archival date.
